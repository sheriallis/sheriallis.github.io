          <h1>Hi, I'm Sheri Richardson</h1>
          <p>
            As a Front-end developer with an eye for design I'm always looking
            for new opportunities to learn, grow and enhance my skill set. I
            build quality websites that are accessible and responsive using the
            latest web technologies.

              What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet
              square, was moving across the sand in their direction. When it
              came near enough he perceived that it was not grass; there were no
              blades, but only purple roots. The roots were revolving, for each
              small plant in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless
              wheel.
